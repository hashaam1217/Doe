[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findtriton_interfaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "triton_interfaces", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "triton_interfaces"
  with any of the following names:

    triton_interfacesConfig.cmake
    triton_interfaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "triton_interfaces" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "triton_interfaces_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "triton_interfaces" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
